With proper maintenance, the AC should provide long-term service. Here are some common auto AC problems and components to replace for better performance.</p>
        <ul>
       <li><h5><u>Contamination</u></h5></li>
       <p>Before you opt for an AC service, you might want to flush your AC system to clear it of dirt and debris. Contamination could very well be the sole culprit of a vehicle’s AC problems. Even if it's not, putting a new part in a clogged system will prevent the new part from functioning well either.</p>
       <li><h5><u>Leakage </u></h5></li>
       <p>The auto Air conditioning system cools the vehicle by using a refrigerant, or Freon, to get rid of the heat. The Freon circulates through the Air conditioning system and is not supposed to run out. However, it might leak out. Leaks occur due to wear and tear of the rubber seals, grommets and O-rings in the system. If you want to restore the performance of the AC unit, consider replacing these worn out components with new and possibly better ones.</p>

       <p>TThere are belts and pulleys in the AC set-up, and they are connected to the engine. The belts can wear out over time, so you should check their condition regularly and replace as and when necessary. </p>
